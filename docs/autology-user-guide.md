# Autology User Guide

Map of Contents for Autology user documentation.

## Three Ways to Use Autology

1. **Skills** (Recommended): `/tutorial`, `/capture`, `/explore`, `/sync`
2. **Native Tools** (Direct): Claude's Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob tools on docs/
3. **Obsidian**: Visual graph browsing and editing

## Guide Sections

Documentation is captured as autology nodes. Use `/autology:explore` to traverse the knowledge graph — hub nodes, neighborhoods, and paths between concepts.
